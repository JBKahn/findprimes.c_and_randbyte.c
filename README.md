findprimes.c_and_randbyte.c
===========================

Two programs written in C for school

findprimes.c

Finds all prime numbers up to a given bound using the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" algorithm using a given number of children. These children are assignment numbers to use by the parent process through pipes and are checked to ensure they do not overstep their position in the algorithm.

randbyte.c

Prints a single random byte (character) of one or more files. without files listed it will do this with stdin.
